# SpeciesSQL

#### This SQL code utilizes data from a personal project I have been working on for the past few years. The source data was collected by myself, using a combination of the NPS online database and my own personal collection of field guides. This combines two of my biggest passions :) Ecology and Technology

### I have set up a personal SQL Server on my personal machine, and utilize SSMS.

### To get the clearest picture of the flow and synergy of the tables and etls, please view the diagram I have made (with handy links if viewed as a pdf, which can be found [here](https://emathieson.github.io/PORTFOLIONEW/SpeciesSQL%20Diagram_.pdf) on my personal portfolio site. Screenshots for context also availabe through the diagram.

### Thanks for looking!
